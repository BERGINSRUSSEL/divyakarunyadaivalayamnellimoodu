                                         <p>Jesus Youth is an international Catholic youth movement with a charismatic spirituality. It had its beginnings in Kerala (India), but is now active in nearly 35 countries around the world.
                                         <br><br>Jesus Youth is an initiative of young people themselves, who, filled with the Holy Spirit try to reach out to other young people. The strength of the movement is its special focus on a life centered on the Lord Jesus Christ: beginning with an experience of God nourished by prayer, the Word of God, the sacraments and fellowship, and sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ with others.
                                         <br><br>Though not an actual community, Jesus Youth is a network of small but vibrant groups of young people. In their own life situations, they strive to give time to the Lord, responding to the challenges of today’s world in the power of the Holy Spirit.
                                         <br><br>Jesus Youth is active in nearly 25 countries and has a national network and a definite infrastructure in countries like USA, Canada, Italy, Ireland, UK, Germany, UAE, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, India, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand. There are regional teams and groups in countries like Austria, Switzerland, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Cambodia.</p>
                                     
                                      <br><br><h3>At the service of the church</h3>
                                      <p>On 29th October 2008, Jesus Youth received the approval from the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India (CBCI) and His Grace Archbishop Abraham Viruthakulangara was appointed as the Ecclesiastical Advisor.

                                        The process of being recognised as an ‘International Private Association of Christian Faithful of Pontifical Right’ officially began on 24th August 2009 with the Pontifical Council for the Laity.

                                        <br><br><h3>Ministries</h3>
                                      <p>Jesus Youth ministries are founded on a firm spiritual basis and flourish in the context of growing fellowships. The formation teams gather together to develop the ministry and engage in the apostolate, provide mutual support and promote spiritual growth.

                                            <br><br>With the vision of sharing the faith and building a witnessing community, Jesus Youth has developed various ministries for its members. A Jesus Youth ministry is usually the initiative of an individual or a small fellowship, and normally tries to share Jesus in a particular context, using one’s talent or charism. These initiatives gradually grow into ministries of Jesus Youth. While helping young people to come together and grow in fellowship, these ministries also prepare youth to embrace the Gospel in their daily life and to proclaim the Gospel to others.

                                            <br><br>Each ministry has a co-ordinating team and a set of formation and outreach programmes. In Jesus Youth there are a number of ministries focusing on different areas such as:

                                            A Jesus Youth group exists in a locality (parish, institution, work site, etc.) and is comprised of a number of cells and small groups and is coordinated by a Core Team. A Zonal Team co-ordinates the Jesus Youth groups and ministries in a zonal area.

                                            <br><br>A number of zones or a state constitutes a region and it is co-ordinated by a Regional Jesus Youth Team. At the national level, the co-ordination is done by the National Team and the Jesus Youth International Team co-ordinates all these National Teams.

                                            <br><br>Being a Catholic movement, Jesus Youth is accountable to the Catholic Hierarchy of each area and functions under the guidance of the local Catholic Bishops.

                                            <br><br>The selection of a Jesus Youth Team is the result of a process of discernment by a Discerning Community, guided by a Discernment Team. The whole process is done in a spirit of prayer and confidentiality to facilitate the work of the Holy Spirit and the building up of the Christian Community.

                                               <li> a) Cell groups
                                                In Jesus Youth, young people and families are encouraged to come together regularly for prayer and fellowship. Such steadily growing cells, with 5 to 10 members, ensure their ongoing spiritual formation and are important means for mutual enrichment and spiritual guidance.

                                            <li>b) Small groups
                                                These groups can be hosted in homes, offices, colleges, etc. Maximum number for such a group is 15 so when the group numbers around 12, it is time to multiply, i.e., split the group into two. Jesus Youth Prayer and study materials are key tools in these small group gatherings.

                                            <li>c) Prayer groups
                                                A group that gathers together every week for prayer, teaching and fellowship creates a favourable environment for personal growth and ministry building in Jesus Youth. A Prayer Meeting could comprise of an informal but lively time of praise and worship, a Spirit- filled Bible teaching/sharing and a time of intercession and interaction.
