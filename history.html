                            <h5 class="description">When we think about Blessed Sacrament Church(BS Church) first thing that come to our mind is the establishment of first Diocse in Asis by the proclaimation of Pope Jone 22 at Kollam in Kerala and the first Bishop being Jordanos Kathalani. PesentThiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Neyyattinkara Diocese were under Kollam. The second Diocese at that time was established at Ranchi. Due to various reason the development of Diocese came to a stand still.<br>
                            Between 1915 and 1916 measeles became widespread in the Nellimoodu regions. Sisters under the leadership and participation of Mulluvila Parishpriest Rev. Fr.Bitharmore visited the house of the affected and took care of them. As a result lots of families in the region were saved from the hand of death. During that time Nellimoodu region was under the Mulluvila Parish. Seeing the kind service mentallity, Marthandan Vyapari accepted the name Masilamani and along with his family was baptisised and became Christians. As for rememberence he purchsed and donated a small area of land at Nellimoodu. A filial church dedicated to St. Sebastian was constructed in the area. The filial church was later renovated twice and that is present here even today.<br>
                            The region of Nellimoodu was under the Parish Holy Family Church of Mulluvila and the first priest being Rev Fr Mercilayil Koipparambil. In 1916 Rev Fr Betharman took charge as Parish Priest. Rev Fr. Pathrose Fernandaz took charge as parish priest from 1922. It was during his period B S Church was constructed and blessed. It was done on April 24 1924. <br>
                            BS Church was the substation under Mulluvila church. Rev Fr Constantin serve as parish priest from April 15 1925. From April 04 1928 Rev Fr. Rev Fr Peter Christy was parish priest. Rev Fr Alfred Kamoins served as parish priest from June 6 1929 and Rev Fr Simon John from November 26 1931. From June 8 1933 Rev Fr Paul Anverthan was the parish priest.<br>
                            Rev Fr. Paul Anverthan Fernandaz was a parish member of St. Sebastian Church Neendakara Kollam. He spent most of his time for the development and upliftment of people of B S Church and Nellimoodu Area. He was the one who introduced self employment in the zone that has not even heared about that before. He started a tapioca grinding mill near Nellimoodu and uplifted people from hunger and poverty.<br>
                            In 1937 April 1 Diocese of Thiruvananthapuram was formed and the first bishop was Rev Dr. Vincent Deraera of Kollam Diocese. And Rev Dr. Jerome Fernandaz, a native of Kolam Diocese took charge of Kollam Diocese. <br>
                            B S Church was under the parish of Mulluvila from 1924 to 1940 ad 1949 to 1971. From 1940 to 1944 Rev Fr. Paul Avarthan was th parish priest and controlled everything from Kamukinkode. From 1944 to 1949, Rev Fr Manuvel Anpadi served as parish priest<br>
                            Again the parish was brought under Mulluvila and Rev Fr Mark Netto from Kaniyapuram parish was the priest priest. He was also a great historian. "Education for All" was his motto. Rev Fr Basil Fernandz became parish priest from 1951 to 1953. From 1953 to 1955 Rev Fr Xavierleen was the parish priest.
